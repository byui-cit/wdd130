          This Week we will finish up our version of the Astronomy Pic of the
          Day site. We will add a form that will allow a user to request a pic
          from a specific day instead of only giving the current day.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Build and Style the form</h2>
            <p>
              Begin by reviewing the
              <a href="apod/site-plan.html">site plan</a> again to see the
              details of what we are attempting to create. Pay special attention
              to the form portion on the top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add the HTML and CSS necessary to make a form that matches the one
              in the mockup. Use a normal <code>type="text"</code> input for the
              date.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->

            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <p>
              We should write up a list of steps to indicate how the page should
              function.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                When the Get Image button is clicked:
                <ol>
                  <li>Get the date from the text input</li>
                  <li>
                    Build a new URL using the date that will request the image
                    from that day.
                  </li>
                  <li>Request the image</li>
                  <li>
                    Check the response, if it is not ok show an error to the
                    user with the message sent back from the server.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the response is OK (we got an image) display it. and hide
                    any errors that might be showing.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Begin by creating a function called <kbd>getApodByDate</kbd>. Then
              add an event listener to the "Get Image" button that will call the
              new function when the button is clicked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Complete the <kbd>getApodByDate</kbd> function. It should get the
              value out of the input, and append it to the URL we used last week
              along with the <code>date</code> filter and the value from our
              input. The new URL should look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">apodUrl + `&date=${date.value}`</code></pre>
            assuming that
            <code
              >apodUrl =
              "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY"</code
            >

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Error checking</h2>
            <p>
              In the list of steps above we listed the need to check to make
              sure that we got good data back from the API. Whenever you allow
              input from users there is the chance that soemthing will break. We
              need to make sure it breaks gracefully :)
            </p>
            <p>
              First update the <code>getApod(url)</code> function that we
              created last week. When we get a response from a server through
              fetch, there is always a property called <code>ok</code>. This
              will be true if things worked, and false if some sort of problem
              happened. Add an if statement to your function to check
              <code>ok</code>. An example of how that might look is given below
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
async function getApod(url) {
    const res = await fetch(url);
    const data = await res.json();
    // check to make sure we got a good response
    if (res.ok) {
        // success...make sure any previous error message is gone.
        
        //return the data
    } else {
        // error...output the message returned by the server
        
        // return false to show that something went wrong
    }
    }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              To make finishing the above function easier, add two more
              functions. Stubs for them can be found below
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
function showError(msg) {
    //get the error element
   
    //set the content of the element to the msg
    
    // remove the hide class
    
}
function hideError() {
    //get the error element
    
    // clear out the content of the element
    
    // add the hide class
    
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Finish implementing those functions, then use them in
              <code>getApod</code> to show errors when appropriate.
            </p>

            <h2>Make the Grid more responsive</h2>
            <p>
              Your page should now be looking finished and good...as long as the
              browser window is wide enough. Try reducing the width of your
              browser however. What do you notice?
            </p>
            <p>
              At narrow widths the image gets really small, and the text really
              long. Not ideal. It would be good to change the layout slightly
              when the screen gets too small. One way we can do this is by
              taking advantage of CSS grid <code>repeat()</code> and
              <code>auto-fit</code>. Review again the article on
              <a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/"
                >auto sizing columns in grid</a
              >
              that you should have read earlier this week.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based off of the contents of that article see if you can modify
              your <code>grid-template-columns</code> to make it so that the
              columns can never be smaller than <kbd>400px</kbd>, and never
              bigger than <kbd>1fr</kbd>. Use <code>repeat</code> and
              <code>auto-fit</code> as well so that our grid will switch between
              one and two columns automatically as needed. Once you have your
              solution you can check the solution below
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>Auto-fit grid columns</summary>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">.photo {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, 1fr));
    gap: 2em;
}</code></pre>
            </details>

            <h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>

            <p>
              Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes
              then check to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a
              review on how to do this check out
              <a
                href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder2/"
                >github instructions</a
              >. Start around step 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
              page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
              <kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/apod</kbd>. Make sure
              to replace "githubusername" with YOUR actual github username :)
