        <h2>Activity&nbsp;Instructions</h2>
        <p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
        <p>
          This week we will take the simple blog site that you started
          developing last week and finish the styling for it so that it matches
          the mockup. We will also then make the page somewhat dynamic by
          generating some of the markup for the page with Javascript.
        </p>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Finish styling the articles.</h2>
            <p>
              The main part of the page that we have yet to style is the
              article. We began last week by adding a grid to accomplish some of
              the layout.
            </p>
            <p>
              Review once again the mockup below then make a list of steps that
              you can see need to be done to make our page match the mockup.
              Once you have created your list compare it to the one below.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The size of the font for the date of the article should be
                  increased
                </li>
                <li>
                  The list of details on the left should all be right aligned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The space between the lines of the list of details on the left
                  should be slightly reduced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a right border to the container holding the list of
                  details and add spacing on the left and right of that to match
                  the mockup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adjust the top margin of the title of the post so that it
                  lines up vertically with the date on the left.
                </li>
                <li>Center the image of the bookcover.</li>
                <li>Add some space in between the two articles</li>
                <li>
                  Since we restricted the width on the navbar last week (review
                  that CSS rule if you need to) we should do the same to the
                  <code>main</code> element as well so that it matches and we
                  end up with nice alignment.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            <p>How did you do? Did you notice all of the details?</p>
            <p>
              Using the list above as a guide, write the CSS to style the
              articles.

            <h2>Add some Javascript</h2>
            <p>
              If this were a real blog site it would be nice if we didn't have
              to change the index page each time we added a new post. Many sites
              operate in this way. In order to do this we need to dynamically
              generate the HTML markup for the articles instead of having it be
              hard coded in the HTML file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last week you were instructed to download a
              <kbd>articles.js</kbd> file and add it to the
              <kbd>blog/</kbd> directory. That file contains a variable called
              <code>articles</code> that contains an array of information about
              articles. We can use that array to build out the HTML markup we
              need to dynamically build the list of articles on our page.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              On a real site the articles data would be pulled stored in a
              database and requested as needed. In order to keep ours simple we
              will just store it in a variable locally.
            </p>
            <p>
              To proceed, connect your new JS file to the
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> file in that directory by adding a
              <code>script</code> element. Don't forget to <code>defer</code>!
            </p>
            <p>
              Just like we did above with the CSS, it would be good to come up
              with a list of steps to follow in order to solve our problem.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Get a reference to the element we want to insert our articles
                into. You may need to add a class or ID to the element your
                articles are currently in to do this. (document.querySelector)
              </li>
              <li>
                For each article in our list:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Create a new <code>article</code> element. If you have any
                    classes on your hard coded articles in your index.html, add
                    those to your new element in Javascript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Create a template literal string and store it in a variable.
                    The contents of this string should be a copy/paste of the
                    contents of one of your current <code>articles</code> from
                    the HTML file.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Everywhere in the copy/pasted HTML where there is
                    information specific to this post we should replace it with
                    the data from the current article. (${item.date})
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Set the <code>innerHTML</code> of the new article to the
                    template literal string we just built.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Append the new article to the output element so it will show
                    on the page.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Create one or more functions that will be responsible to build and
              output the HTML necessary to display the list of articles.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                The <code>articles</code> variable you were given is an array of
                objects. We will learn more next week about creating objects,
                but we have already been using them without knowing. For example
                the <code>document</code> we reference when we do something like
                <code>document.querySelector()</code> is an object that has
                <kbd>properties</kbd>, and <kbd>methods</kbd> (functions) that
                belong to it. when we want to reference a certain part of the
                object we use the dot operator.
              </p>
              <p>
                So if we wanted to use the title of the first object in our
                <code>variables</code> array we would write
                <code>articles[0].title</code>. We can use a loop such as the
                <code>Array.forEach</code> loop we studied this week to make it
                easy to access each object in the array one at a time no matter
                how many items there are in the array.
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Cleanup/Add a new post.</h2>
            <p>
              Once you have the Javascript working and it is adding the articles
              dynamically you might notice that you have two copies of each
              article on your page. Go into the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file and
              remove the HTML that produces the articles. We don't need it
              anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              For fun let's see how easy it would be to add an new article. In
              the <kbd>articles.js</kbd> file copy one of the objects that
              contains the information about our books. Paste it below the last
              item in the array (don't forget to add a comma). Then you can
              change the title to one of your favorite books. Change the other
              items if you want. It would look something like below:
            </p>
