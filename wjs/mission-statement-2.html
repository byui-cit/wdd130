          This week we will continue working with the Mission statement page we
          created last week. We will add some Javascript to allow a user to
          choose a light or dark theme for the page. We created the light theme
          last week, we will also need to add the CSS for the dark theme now.

            <h2>Organizing our thoughts.</h2>
            <p>
              Let's begin by creating a list of steps again to solve the problem
              at hand.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Add a <code>select</code> element to our page with two options:
                light, dark. Make sure that the light option is first so it
                comes up by default.
              </li>
              <li>Add a class to <code>body</code> called "dark"</li>
              <li>
                Define a rule in the CSS with the <code>.dark</code> selector to
                make all the changes necessary to convert our design to the dark
                theme.
              </li>
              <li>
                After getting the dark theme done remove the
                <code>dark</code> class from the <code>body</code> element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a JS file called <kbd>mission.js</kbd> and add a
                <code>script</code> element to our HTML file to link them
                together.
              </li>
              <li>
                With JavaScript select the <code>select</code> element out of
                the DOM.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add an event listener to the selected element. We should listen
                for a <kbd>change</kbd> event.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a function called <code>changeTheme</code> that will get
                called by the event listener when the select option is changed.
                That function should do the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Check to see what option is currently selected on our theme
                    selector.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If it is "dark" then add the <code>dark</code> class to body
                    and change the logo src to the white logo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If it is not "dark" then remove the <code>dark</code> class
                    from the body element and change the image src for the logo
                    to the blue logo.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>That is a pretty good list. Let's get started.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Modify the HTML</h2>
            <p>
              A dropdown list is a great way to offer a user a limited list of
              choices. In HTML we create a dropdown with a
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select"
                >select</a
              >
              element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add a <code>select</code> element to the top of your HTML page. It
              should have two options: light and dark. Use those for both the
              value and the display of the option. You will probably need to
              review the link above for help with the syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add the class of <code>dark</code> to the
              <code>body</code> element. We do this now for development
              purposes. We will remove it once we have our dark theme working
              and add it back in with Javascript later when needed.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Style the dark theme.</h2>

            <p>
              we will start the dark theme with the following changes: set the
              background color to <kbd>#333</kbd>, a nice dark grey. Then set
              the font color to white.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a look at the page with those changes. What do you notice?
              The subtitle we made blue last week. The blue on black is a little
              hard to read. This could actually be an
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility"
                >accessibility</a
              >
              issue. Making a site accessible mean that we do everything we can
              to make it work for everyone, including people who make have some
              sort of disability like vision issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accessibility guidelines recommend that the contrast between
              colors be at least 4 for smaller text. We can easily check this in
              Chrome or Firefox. These instructions will assume you are using
              Chrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the Developer tools (right-click anywhere on the page and
              choose "Inspect"
            </p>
            <p>
              In the "Elements" tab find the <code>h2</code> element that holds
              our subtitle and click on it. This will show us the CSS that is
              being applied to that element. Find the rule that chages the color
              to blue. You should see a little blue color swatch next to the
              hexadecimal value. Click on the color swatch.
            </p>
            <img
              src="../images/chrome-check-color-contrast.png"
              alt="checking color contrast in Chrome developer tools."
            />
            <p>
              You will see a color picker pop up. One of the bits of information
              on it is the current foreground/background contrast of colors.
              Ours is currently 2.34. That is too low! We need a new blue color
              with better contrast. Many organizations have branding style
              guides to help establish a brand. BYUI is no exception. You can
              find their branding guide <a href="">here</a>. Notice there is a
              colors section. Go check it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see that the main blue color is "#006EB6". It also lists
              several more colors below that can be used for accent. Try the
              different blues in the list to find one with a good contrast. Add
              a new rule that will change the blue color on the H2 to your
              lighter blue when the dark theme is set. If you get stuck check
              out the partial solution below. (Remember that we can write
              complex selectors to say things like: "Find an H2 that is
              <em>inside</em> of an element that has a class of "dark")
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>Partial solution</summary>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">
.dark h2 {
    color: somecolor;
}
                </code></pre>
            </details>
            <p>
              The last thing that we need to look at is the logo. It is the same
              blue that the subtitle was, and so has the same contrast issues.
              If we look at another
              <a href="https://www.byui.edu/branding/logos"
                >part of the branding guide</a
              >
              we can see the rules for using the BYUI logo. Notice that when the
              logo is used on a dark background they recommend white text. Below
              you will find a new image with white text.
            </p>

            <img
              src="../images/byui-logo_white.png"
              alt="byui logo white"
              style="background-color: #333"
            />

            <p>
              We won't change the image right now, but will do it later with
              Javascript...but you should grab that image and save it as part of
              your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have the dark theme looking how you would like then
              remove the <code>dark</code> class from the <code>body</code>
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Write the Javascript</h2>
            <p>
              Create a file called <kbd>mission.js</kbd> in the mission folder.
              Add a <code>script</code> element to our HTML to link up these two
              files. Remember to <code>defer</code> your script!
            </p>
            <p>
              If we review the list of steps above we can see the following is
              left:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                With JavaScript select the <code>select</code> element out of
                the DOM.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add an event listener to the selected element. We should listen
                for a <kbd>change</kbd> event.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a function called <code>changeTheme</code> that will get
                called by the event listener when the select option is changed.
                That function should do the following:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Check to see what option is currently selected on our theme
                    selector.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If it is "dark" then add the <code>dark</code> class to body
                    and change the logo src to the white logo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If it is not "dark" then remove the <code>dark</code> class
                    from the body element and change the image src for the logo
                    to the blue logo.
