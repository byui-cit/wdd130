              After reviewing the wireframe spend some time thinking about what
              parts of the layout should be grouped together in HTML, and what
              tags you might use to do that.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              Notice that the Filters portion of the page is not complete in the
              mockup. We will do that part later.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Write the HTML</h2>
            <p>
              Add a new directory called <kbd>blog</kbd> to your WDD130
              directory. Add new <kbd>index.html</kbd> and
              <kbd>blog.css</kbd> files inside that new directory. Then open the
              main <kbd>index.html</kbd> for your site (the one at the root of
              the WDD130 directory) and add a link to this new page
              (<kbd>blog/</kbd>). Finally download this
              <a href="../teacher/blog/articles.js">javascript file</a> and add
              it to the <kbd>blog/</kbd> directory with the others. This file
              contains information you can use as you write the HTML about a
              couple of books.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next write the HTML you will need to display all of the content
              from the wireframe. Make sure to keep semantics in mind. As well,
              make sure to use elements to group related parts of the page
              together.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                When thinking about semantics, you should think in terms of the
                parts of the page ie: lists, paragraphs, headlines, headers,
                footers, etc. For example the navigation is made up of a list of
                links right? So it would make sense to use the HTML element that
                matches (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>)
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              You can skip the filter form for now as we will learn about forms
              in the next unit. Do leave a space for it though. Leave yourself a
              note for now, something like
              <code>&lt;p&gt;Filter form will go here&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Choose some colors and a Font.</h2>

            <p>
              Spend a few minutes thinking about colors and fonts. Pick 2-3
              colors you think would work well together. You can use a resource
              like <a href="https://coolors.co" target="_blank">Coolors</a> to
              help with this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then pick one or two fonts you like from either the
              <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-safe-html-css-fonts"
                >web safe font list</a
              >, or <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Start your CSS by writing your general styles. Set the font family
              for body and headlines, font sizes, colors, link styles, etc.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you would like to match the colors and fonts in the mockup
                instead of choosing your own they are listed below:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gold color: #EFC69B</li>
                <li>Red color: #AF1B3F</li>
                <li>Dark color: #473144</li>
                <li>Body font: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif</li>
                <li>
                  Headline font: Lora, Impact, serif (Lora can be found on
                  Google Fonts.)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Add the CSS for the layout.</h2>
            <p>
              Using the CSS Grid that we studied this week, write the CSS to
              apply the layout from the wireframe to your page.
            </p>
            <p>There are 3 places where we will need to use simple grids.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>For the navigation in the header</li>
              <li>
                For the main body of the page to get the articles to appear on
                the left and the box that will hold the filters on the right.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inside of each article to get the details on the left and the
                title, image, and description on the right.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We will do the first grid for the navigation together, then you
              can finish the others on your own.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need a 3 column grid for the navigation. We can use relative
              units like <code>fr</code> or exact units (<code>px</code>). In
              this case where we know how long each link will be and thus the
              amount of space each needs, and because the menu is aligned to the
              right side of the layout exact units will work better.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create the grid for the navigation we need to look at the HTML
              structure we used for the links and identify the Grid container
              and the Grid Items. If your HTML looked similar to what is below:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              What element would be the container and which elements the items?
              What selector would you use to select the container?
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>Solution</summary>
              <p>
                Container would be the <code>ul</code>, the items would be the
                <code>li</code>. For a selector you could use something like
                <code>nav > ul</code>, OR you could add a class directly to the
                UL and use that class for a selector. IE
                <code>&lt;ul class="main-nav"&gt;</code>, and then
                <code>.main-nav</code> as the selector.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may need to adjust this based on how close your HTML for the
                navigation is to the code above.
              </p>
            </details>
            <p>
              Once you have identified your grid container, add the CSS rule to
              turn on grid for that element and create 3 columns wide enough to
              fit the text of the links (you may want to refer back to the
              mockup above)
            </p>
            <p>
              Your page should look similar to the screenshot below at this
              point.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/book-review-nav-started.jpeg"
                alt="navigation grid"
              />
              <figcaption>First Grid added</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              We have one more Grid related task for the navigation. The Grid
              needs to be on the right side of the screen instead of the left.
              This is easy to do with the Grid alignment tools. We can use
              <code>justify-content: end;</code>, and
              <code>justify-items: end;</code> to re-align it. We will learn
              more about CSS Grid alignment in a later lesson, but if you want a
              preview check out those properties in the
              <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/"
                >CSS Tricks Grid Guide</a
              >
              for some idea about how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the first Grid as a model you now should add the other two
              grids to the page. One to take the article details and place them
              to the left of the article content, and the other to place the
              articles to the left of the box that will contain our filters. Add
              the CSS to create those two grids.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should follow the same process of identifying the Grid
              Container and Grid Items first. If all of the elements you need to
              be Grid Items do not share the same parent in the HTML, you may
              need to change your HTML structure so that they do.
            </p>

            <h2>Finish styling the header</h2>
            <p>
              We got a start on the last step on styling the header, but it
              still doesn't look like the mockup. We should finish it now. Refer
              back often to the wireframe and mockup to make sure that you pay
              attention to the spacing and alignment details.
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it useful when approaching tasks like this to make a list
              of steps to solve the problem. A list in this case might look
              similar to the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Increase the size of the title of the page, center it, and add
                some padding to match the spacing in the mockup.
              </li>
              <li>Remove the bullets on the navigation list.</li>
              <li>
                Add the lines above and below the navigation element. (border)
              </li>
              <li>
                In the mockup it appears that the navigation links do not go all
                the way to the right edge. Try setting a
                <code>max-width</code> and centering the block by setting
                <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                It looks like the font size of the links is larger than the
                normal font size. Make it so.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increase the height of the navbar to match the mockup. (try
                padding or line-height)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Once you have the header styled (and matching the mockup as
              closely as you can) you are done for this week. We will finish the
              styling for the articles next week. Your page should look similar
              to below. (Your colors and fonts do not have to match the
              screenshot)
