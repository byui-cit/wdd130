        <h1>Your personal Site Plan</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          In the previous weeks you should have come up with an idea for your
          personal website. Before we build our personal (final) project we need
          to do some planning. You were given a site plan when we began work on
          the Astronomy Picture of the Day site. It contained many of the
          details we needed to know in order to build that site. We should
          prepare a similar document for our personal sites now.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Create a new folder for your new site</h3>
            <p>
              Let's start by adding a folder to the 'wdd130' folder. You can do
              this in file management or on Visual Studio Code.
            </p>

            <p>
              Give this folder a name and remember this will be a part of the
              URL (web address), so keep it short, simple, and professional. The
              folder name should be all lowercase with no spaces. The name
              should also have something to do with the topic of your personal
              site. This folder will be at the root level of your directory and
              will contain the new personal site project.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Add Site Plan Files</h3>
            <p>
              Add a file to your new folder called <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>.
              The example here shows the new folder called 'dress4success'.
              Yours will, of course, have a different named folder. You also
              don't need a README.md file like is shown in the images if you
              don't choose to have one.
            </p>

                alt="new site-plan.html file screen shot"
              />
            </figure>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="site-plan.html" target="_blank">Site Plan Template</a>,
              right-click on the page, and view the source code. (On Chrome it's
              the pop-up menu option called 'View Page Source'.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Copy <strong>all</strong> the HTML code. You can use Cmd+A or
              Ctrl+A to select it all quickly, then copy it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paste the code into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> page in VSCode
              and save the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create a new 'styles' folder. And create a
              <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file inside that folder.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="https://byui-wdd.github.io/wdd130/images/w07/new_css.png"
                alt="new style folder and file screen shot"
              />
            </figure>
            <p>
              Go to:
              <a href="site-plan.css" target="_blank">Site Plan CSS</a>
              and copy <strong>all</strong> the code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paste the code into the <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file in VSCode
              and save it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you look at the new site plan template, you will notice it is
              very similar to the last one. It does have a new section though:
              Content. For the other pages we have made you were provided with
              content, but you will need to generate all of the content (text
              and media) for your site.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will also be required to create two wireframes: one for each
              page of your site.
