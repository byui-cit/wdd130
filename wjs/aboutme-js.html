            <h2>Organizing our thoughts.</h2>
            <p>
              To get some practice using Javascript to modify a web page, we
              will add a note to the bottom of our about-me page that will show
              the current day. Whenever you start a new programming project, it
              is a good idea to list out the steps we will need to follow in
              order to solve the problem. If we can make our list in small
              enough steps, each step becomes trivial. That is the goal.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get the current date and store it in a variable</li>
              <li>Extract the Day from the current date</li>
              <li>
                Add the HTML to our page to display the message ie "Welcome,
                today is"
              </li>
              <li>
                Add an empty HTML element that we can use to insert the day once
                determined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select the html element we would like to display the day in
                using Javascript.
              </li>
              <li>Insert the day into the HTML.</li>

            <h2>Add a Javascript file to our page</h2>
            <p>
              Our list is fairly complete, but there are a couple things we will
              need to do everytime we want to use Javascript on a web page that
              we did not include above. We need to create a javascript file to
              hold our code, and we need to link our HTML to the script file so
              it can work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Open up the <kbd>aboutme/index.html</kbd> file in your editor.
              Create a new file called <kbd>about-me.js</kbd> in the same
              directory as the HTML file (aboutme). Add the following to your
              HTML file in the <code>head</code> element.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src="about-me.js defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              This line of HTML will let the browser know that we want it to get
              the file and run an Javascript in it. To make sure it is working
              add the following line to the <kbd>about-me.js</kbd>:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">console.log("It worked!")</code></pre>
            <p>
              Open your HTML page in the browser (you should have Live Server
              installed in your editor...use that!) Then Right-click anywhere on
              the page and select "Inspect" to open up the browser developer
              tools. Next find and select the "Console" tab and you should see
              the message there. If you do not then check the filename in the
              script src in the HTML file and make sure it matches the actual
              filename.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Get the current Date</h2>

            <p>
              Dates can be somewhat complicated to work with in code, so most
              languages have methods written to help out with that. Javascript
              is no exception. It has a built in
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date"
                >Date()</a
              >
              object that is very helpful. To get the current date we can simply
              do this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">const today = new Date();</code></pre>
            <p>
              Add that line, then right after it add a line to output the
              variable <code>today</code> to the console and check out what we
              got.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Find out which day it is.</h2>
            <p>
              The next step in our list is to extract the current day from the
              date. In the last step you should have seen something like this in
              the console:
              <kbd>Mon Jul 11 2022 13:18:46 GMT-0600 (MDT)</kbd>. We can see
              that it does have the day abbreviation in the string, and while we
              could try and extract it from there, it might end up messy. There
              is a better way.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you return to the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date"
                >Date()</a
              >
              documentation look for something that might help us with our task.
              Did you see it?
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getDay"
                >getDay()</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Use <code>getDay()</code> to get the current day from our date.
            </p>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Add HTML</h2>
            <p>
              The next step in our list was to add some HTML to the page where
              we will display our message including the day of the week. Let's
              put it at the bottom of the page in a footer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add a <code>footer</code> element to your page. Inside of that add
              a paragraph that says "Welcome, today is". After the word "is" we
              need to be able to insert in our day. In order to do this we need
              an element! We need something that will not disrupt the flow of
              the text, and we want the day to be highlighted so let's us the
              <code>strong</code> element. Add one with an id of
              <code>displayToday</code>. <em>After</em> you have it done verify
              what you did with the partial solution below
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>footer solution</summary>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;footer&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome, today is &lt;strong id="displayToday"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
                </code></pre>
              <p>
                Notice how the <code>strong</code> element is empty, and is
                inside of the paragraph. It needs to change based on the actual
                day so we will fill it in with Javascript.
              </p>
            </details>

            <h2>Insert the current day into the HTML</h2>
            <p>We are getting close. The last two steps are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Select the html element we would like to display the day in
                using Javascript.
              </li>
              <li>Insert the day into the HTML.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can use <code>document.getElementById</code> or
              <code>document.querySelector</code> to accomplish the first. Make
              sure to store the element in a variable once you have selected it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can then use <code>textContent</code> to update the element
              with the current day. When you do this however you will notice a
              problem. Our day is given to us as a number! We need the full name
              of the day. We need a simple way to convert the number to the
              actual name. An Array will be perfect for this. Review the reading
              from this week on
              <a

                >Arrays</a
              >, then see if you can solve the problem on your own. Remember
              that the parts of an array can be accessed with an index. After
              you have come up with your solution, compare it with the solution
              below.

            <h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>
            <p>
              You should have created a github repo for your work earlier this
              week. We need to now take the updates we have just made and send
              them to Github so they can be seen online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commit your changes, then push them. Wait a few minutes then check
              to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a review on
              how to do this check out

            </p>

            <p>
              After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
              page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
              <kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/aboutme</kbd>. Make
              sure to replace "githubusername" with YOUR actual github username
