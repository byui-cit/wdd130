        <p>Estimated Time: 2 hours</p>
        <p>
          This activity will have you create a page to display a new picture
          every day retrieved from an open API that NASA provides. You will be
          provided a site plan for the page we will be building. You will need
          to pay close attention to the detail in the plan (which includes a
          wireframe and Mockup) and apply padding, margin, font-size,
          line-height, letter-spacing, centering, Grid, and more to get it
          right.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Review the site plan</h2>
            <p>
              Begin by reviewing the
              <a href="apod/site-plan.html">site plan</a> to see the details of
              what we are attempting to create. All of the information we need
              to successfully create this page is there. As you review the
              wireframe try and look for relationships and groupings in the
              layout that we might need to represent in the HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
              Create a new folder to hold this project called
              <kbd>apod</kbd>. Then create an html file: <kbd>index.html</kbd>,
              a javascript file: <kbd>apod.js</kbd> and a css file:
              <kbd>apod.css</kbd>. Add the HTML you need to have a valid new
              page as well as a <kbd>link</kbd> element for your CSS and a
              <kbd>script</kbd> for your Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure to add a new link to the site
              <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file as well!
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Write the HTML</h2>
            <p>
              Next add the HTML to display the content. Create the elements that
              will house the major parts of the page first: <code>header</code>,
              <code>main</code>, and <code>footer</code>. The header will just
              contain the title of the site. (You can find that in the site
              plan. Tip: you can copy/paste the planet emoticon!)
            </p>
            <p>
              In the footer we will provide some attribution to NASA. Refer
              again to the site plan for the language. The link goes to
              <kbd>https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html</kbd>
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point we really just need 3 more containers in
              <code>main</code> and we will be close on the HTML. We need an
              element to hold the search form (You can leave this empty for now.
              We will code that up next week), and element for use in displaying
              errors which will intially be hidden, and an element which we will
              insert the picture and info into once we retrieve them. Add
              classes to those elements. We will need them later for styling
              and/or Javascript.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Retrieve an image.</h2>
            <p>
              Instead of jumping into the CSS, we are actually going to move to
              some Javascript. We can't easily finish the HTML until we have the
              information from the API!
            </p>
            <p>
              In the <kbd>apod.js</kbd> file create a variable
              <code>apodUrl</code>. Set it equal to
              <code>https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Next write a function that will use that URL to fetch the current
              picture of the day. Once you have it you should
              <code>console.log</code>, or otherwise inspect the object we got
              back. Pay attention to all the fields. Then refer back to the
              wireframe. Take note of the information we are displaying, then
              find where each bit is stored in the data we got back from the
              API.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next create a template function that we will use to combine the
              data with some HTML. Make sure again to keep the wireframe/mockup
              in mind as you decide how to structure your HTML. After you have
              written your function you can check below to see one possible
              solution.
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>photo Template function</summary>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">function photoTemplate(photo) {
return `&lt;section class="photo"&gt;
    &lt;img src=${photo.url} alt="${photo.title}"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;${photo.title}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;${photo.date}&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;${photo.explanation}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;`;
}</code></pre>
            </details>
            <p>
              Finally write a <code>init()</code> function. In that function
              would should call the other two functions we created to retrieve
              the data, format the data with HTML, and then insert the HTML into
              our page.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Style</h2>
            <p>
              In the <kbd>apod.css</kbd> file begin writing the CSS to make your
              page match the details in the site plan and mockup. Below are a
              few things to note:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For the error box, since we haven't implemented it yet, type
                something into it, then apply your styling. Once you have it
                looking the way you like then remove your text, and hide it.
              </li>
              <li>
                To hide the error box the easiest way would probably be to
                create a rule in your CSS like this:
                <code>.hide { display: none; }</code>. Then add that as a second
                class to your error box. ie:
                <code>&lt;section class="error hide"&gt;</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                The images that come back from NASA will probably be larger than
                the space we want to display them in. Remember that you can use
                <code>max-width</code> to make them fit.
              </li>
              <li>
                One thing that is not easy to determine from the site plan is
                how wide the whole page should be. Let's keep the width of
                <code>main</code> to no more than 960px.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                The site plan provides all the colors which we should use, below
                you can find that information provided in the form of
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties"
                  >CSS custom properties</a
                >
                (CSS variables). These are a great way of keeping track of
                things like colors, fonts, etc. I think it is far easier to
                remember something like <code>--lilac</code> than to remember
                <code>#73628a</code>
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">:root {
--dark-blue: #313d5a;
--platinum: #eaeaea;
--lilac: #73628a;
--fire-opal: #e3655b;
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                Copy/paste the code above into the top of your CSS file, then to
                use them in your CSS you would do something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">a:link,
a:visited {
    color: var(--lilac);
}</code></pre>
            </div>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>

            <p>
              Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes
              then check to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a
              review on how to do this check out
              <a
                href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder2/"
                >github instructions</a
              >. Start around step 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
              page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
              <kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/mission</kbd>. Make
              sure to replace "githubusername" with YOUR actual github username
              :)
            </p>
