        <p>
          This activity will have you re-create the University mission statement
          in HTML and CSS. You will need to pay close attention to detail and
          apply padding, margin, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing,
          centering and more to get it right.

            <h2>Review the mockup</h2>
            <p>
              Begin by reviewing the image below to see what we are attempting
              to create. Try and look for relationships and groupings in the
              layout that we might need to represent in the HTML.

              Create a new folder to hold this project called
              <kbd>mission</kbd>. Then create an html file:
              <kbd>index.html</kbd> and a css file: <kbd>styles.css</kbd>. Add
              the HTML you need to have a valid new page as well as a
              <kbd>link</kbd> element for your CSS.
            </p>

              Next add the HTML to display the content. To save you a bit of

            <div class="callout">

                Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and
                guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its
                mission is to develop disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders
                in their homes, the Church, and their communities.
              </p>
              <p>The university does this by:</p>
              <p>
                Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and
                fostering its principles in a wholesome academic, cultural, and
                social environment. Providing a high-quality education that
                prepares students of diverse interests and abilities for
                lifelong learning and employment. Serving as many students as
                possible within resource constraints. Delivering education that
                is affordable for students and the Church.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>Below you will also find an image for the logo to use.</p>
            <img src="../images/byui-logo_blue.webp" alt="BYUI logo, blue" />
            <p>
              You should Right-click->Save image as... and save the image file
              into the <kbd>mission</kbd> directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure to refer back to the mockup image above often as you
              write your HTML. In particular here are some details to keep in
              mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Try to use semantic elements as much as possible. For example
                the top section with the title and subtitle is the
                <kbd>header</kbd> of the document. The section with the text
                would be the <kbd>main</kbd> portion of the content, and the
                logo at the bottom acts as a sort of <kbd>footer</kbd>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              AFTER you have written your HTML compare it to the example below.
              Your HTML does NOT have to match this potential solution. There is
              more than one way to solve this problem. You should however note
              the differences and think about why.
            </p>
            <p>
              PLEASE do not copy/paste the HTML below into your document. Your
              goal in this course is hopefully to learn HTML. Copy/pasting the
              solution below will NOT help you with this goal. If you see that
              you need to make changes to your HTML based on what you see below,
              fix your code, don't copy/paste.

              <p>
                You may be wondering about the
                <code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;</code> element that I placed
                everything in. This is a fairly common practice, but not always
                necessary. In this case it was used so that some margin could be
                added around the outside of the bordered box to move it away
                from the top of the browser window. See below:
              </p>
              <img
                src="../images/mission-statement-content-box.png"
                alt="example of a content box"
              />
            </details>

          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Style the document.</h2>

            <p>
              In the <kbd>styles.css</kbd> file begin writing the CSS to make
              your page match the mockup. Again here are a few details to keep
              in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The font size has been set to 20px for the default.</li>
              <li>The font used is the default: Times New Roman</li>
              <li>The color for the subtitle is #006EB6</li>
              <li>
                Note that while the titles and the main block of content are
                centered, the paragraphs are left aligned
              </li>
              <li>
                The content inside the box has been limited to a maximum width
                of 600px.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remember that <code>margin</code> adds space between elements,
                while <code>padding</code> adds space inside of an element. You
                will need to use both to match the design.
              </li>
              <li>
                To get the titles to look just right you will need to use the
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing"
                  >letter-spacing</a
                >
                property to space the letters out a bit more than they would
                normally be. You can also use
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform"
                  >text-transform</a
                >
                to make sure they are always all caps.
              </li>
              <li>
                To get yours to match the image you will also need to increase
                the
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height"
                  >line-height</a
                >. (A value of 1.5 is usually nice)
              </li>
              <li>
                The image for the logo is larger than we need. You will need to
                make it smaller. We can use CSS to do this for now. Later we
                will learn how to actually change the image file. You can use
                150px for the size.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>

            <p>
              Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes
              then check to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a
              review on how to do this check out
              <a
                href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder2/"
                >github instructions</a
              >. Start around step 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
              page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
              <kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/mission</kbd>. Make
              sure to replace "githubusername" with YOUR actual github username
              :)
