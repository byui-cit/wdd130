        <p>Estimated Time: 60 minutes</p>
        <p>
          This activity will give you a mostly complete, styled form that could
          be used to register youth for a camp. Our job will be to make the two
          buttons on the form functional.

        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Review the provided HTML/CSS</h2>

            <p>
              Create a new folder to hold this project called
              <kbd>register</kbd>. Then download the
              <a href="../teacher/register/start/form.html">index.html</a> and a
              css file:
              <a href="../teacher/register/start/register.css">register.css</a>
              and place them in your new folder. Add a link as well to this new
              page to your root <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Begin by reviewing the code that makes up the form and the CSS for
              the form. Note that there is a lot going on with the CSS. Most of
              it should look familiar though. The exception might be the section
              where the radio buttons are styled. There will be several new
              things in that section that you may not have seen before. Take a
              look and see if you can figure out what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note as well that there are two buttons on the form. One in the
              Participants section. When that button is clicked we should add
              the HTML to allow the information for a second participant to be
              entered.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other button would be to submit the whole form. When that
              button is clicked we the form should do some basic validation, and
              then pull some information out of the form fields to display a
              simple message to the user to indicate success.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Add Participant Planning</h2>
            <p>
              As is our habit, let's start by listing out the steps we would
              need to follow to make the add participant button functional.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                When the page loads set the current number of participants equal
                to 1
              </li>
              <li>
                Add an event listener to the button. When it is clicked the
                following should happen:
                <ol>
                  <li>Add one to the count of participants.</li>
                  <li>
                    Create a copy of the HTML that makes up the participant
                    section of the form. (<code
                      >&lt;section class="participant1"&gt;</code
                    >
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Note that <code>id</code> attributes are supposed to be
                    unique. If we create an exact copy of that section then we
                    will have duplicate ids. So the next step would be to update
                    the <code>id</code>s of each element with something to make
                    it unique.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Insert the new HTML into the
                    <code>participants</code> fieldset. Ideally we would want to
                    insert the new participant after the last participant and
                    before the Add button.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Add Participant Implementation</h2>
            <p>
              Add another file to the project for our Javascript called
              <kbd>register.js</kbd>. Then add a <code>script</code> element to
              the HTML to connect them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the list of steps above implement your Add Participant
              button. There are a few tips below that should help:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since we will be adding a pretty complex set of HTML, let's
                create a function called
                <code>participantTemplate(count)</code> where
                <code>count</code> is the current number of participants shown.
              </li>
              <li>
                To make the ids unique in our template remember that we can do
                something like this:
                <code>`&lt;section class="participant${count}"&gt;`</code> You
                should add the count to each id in the template.
              </li>
              <li>
                When it is time to insert the new HTML into the form, take a
                look at
                <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd130/wjs/blog-1.html"
                  >insertAdjacentHTML()</a
                >. Notice that we can insert something <code>beforebegin</code>.
                In other words if we select the add button element, and insert
                beforebegin it will place our new participant right where we
                want it.
              </li>
              <li>
                On a wide screen there is enough room to show two participants
                per row. Add some CSS (grid) to make it so that this will
                happen. When you create the two column grid you will need, you
                will need to fix the button so that it always shows up in the
                bottom row. (HINT: if you make it take up both columns it will
                always stay on the bottom row!)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Submit Form plan</h2>

            <p>
              We need a new list of steps for the submit form button. The
              following should happen:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Add an event listener to the <code>form</code>. We are listening
                for a <kbd>submit</kbd> event.
              </li>
              <li>
                On submit we need to keep the form from doing what it normally
                would...which is to reload the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then we need to find all of the <code>fee</code> inputs. There
                will be one for each participant that has been added. The totals
                from those fields need to be summed up.
              </li>
              <li>Get the adult name from the form.</li>
              <li>
                Hide the Form, and show the summary element. Insert the
                following message into the summary element: "Thank you NAME for
                registering. You have registered N participants and owe $N in
                Fees."
              </li>
            </ol>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Submit Form Implementation</h2>

            <p>
              Again here is a list of tips to help you complete the list above:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To keep the form from doing what it normally would we can use
                <code>preventDefault()</code>. Your function would look like
                this:
                <pre><code class="lang-js">function submitForm(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // do the rest of the stuff
}
</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                To keep things organized create another template function for
                the output message...something like
                <code>successTemplate(info)</code> where <code>info</code> will
                be an object with the adult name, number of participants, and
                fee total.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also create a function to calculate the fee total. You can use
                the following stub below for that (Make sure to read the
                comments!):
                <pre><code class="lang-js">function totalFees() {
    // the selector below lets us grab any element that has an id that begins with "fee"
    let feeElements = document.querySelectorAll("[id^=fee]");
    console.log(feeElements);
    // querySelectorAll returns a NodeList. It's like an Array, but not exactly the same.
    // The line below is an easy way to convert something that is list-like to an actual Array so we can use all of the helpful Array methods...like reduce
    // The "..." is called the spread operator. It "spreads" apart the list, then the [] we wrapped it in inserts those list items into a new Array.
    feeElements = [...feeElements];
    // sum up all of the fees. Something like Array.reduce() could be very helpful here :) Or you could use a Array.forEach() as well.
    // Remember that the text that was entered into the input element will be found in the .value of the element.
    
    // once you have your total make sure to return it!
    
  }</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                An easy way to hide an element with only Javascript is
                <pre><code class="lang-js">element.style.display = "none";</code></pre>
                OR you could create a class in your CSS like:
                <pre><code class="lang-css">.hide { display: none; }</code></pre>
                and then in the Javascript do something like
                <pre><code class="lang-css">element.classlist.add('hide')</code></pre>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Refactor</h2>

            <p>
              Refactoring is a process that developers often do once they get
              their code working, but when they see places where the code could
              be improved. The improvements often are to make the code less
              brittle, or easier to maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ended up with two template functions in our code. Those
              functions feel a little different than the other functions since
              they are tied directly with the Web output we are using. Since
              those functions are more HTML than Javascript it could be possible
              that someone on a content team instead of a development team might
              be tasked with making updates when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              To better organize our code add a new file to the project called
              <kbd>Templates.js</kbd> This file will be used as an ES Module. We
              should take both of the template functions and move them to this
              new file. Then they should be <kbd>export</kbd>ed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then in the <kbd>register.js</kbd> file we will need to
              <code>import</code> our templates. Check your code after making
              these changes to make sure everything still works.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Remember that you will need to add <code>type="module"</code> to
                your <code>script</code> element in the HTML in order for ES
                Modules to work!
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;script src="register.js" type="module" &gt;</code></pre>
            </div>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h2>Commit and push to Github</h2>

            <p>
              Commit your changes, then push them to GitHub. Wait a few minutes
              then check to make sure they show on Github pages. If you need a
              review on how to do this check out
              <a
                href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/hosting-git-gihub/ponder2/"
                >github instructions</a
              >. Start around step 3.
            </p>

            <p>
              After verifying that your page updated, submit the URL to your
              page in Ilearn. The URL will look something like this:
              <kbd>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130/register</kbd>. Make
              sure to replace "githubusername" with YOUR actual github username
              :)
