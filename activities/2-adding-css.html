            <p>This week we will continue with the webpage we started in the previous activities. Open up the

                <p>We got all the content in our page last week....but you might of noticed it doesn't look too great.
                    Remember
                    that HTML is responsible to get content on a page, but to style it we use CSS. Make sure you have
                    completed

                    <h3>Review Wireframe</h3>
                    <p>First review the&nbsp;
                        <a href="../images/wireframe-grid-boxes.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a>&nbsp;again to help
                        remember
                        what we are trying to do. Last week we added all of our content to our page, along with some
                        extra
                        HTML to group up related content as necessary.</p>
                    <p>As we added those structural tags last week did you notice anything about them? Whenever
                        possible
                        we tried to use tags that actually described the content they would hold. This concept of
                        using
                        tags with meaning is called
                        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">semantics</a>.
                        This becomes very important as pages become larger and more complex. </p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Semantics</h4>
                        <p>So how do you know which of the semantic elements you should use when adding or grouping content?  Or when a simple
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is the right answer? We shouldn't try to make everything a
                            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> (a section is a portion of the page that contains at least a
                            headline,
                            paragraph, and possibly an image that cannot stand on it's own), and html becomes really
                            hard
                            to read when everything is just in a generic
                            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Here is a
                            <a href="http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png" target="_blank">flowchart</a>
                            that might help. </p>
                        <p>That flowchart talks about using the grouping elements, but what about other tags like
                            &lt;p&gt;
                            or &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;? At the end of the day, writing semantic HTML means that if you
                            need
                            to add a headline to your page you will use a &lt;h2&gt; and not a &lt;p&gt; or a
                            &lt;div&gt;.
                            If you are adding a list of something use a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; and not a bunch of
                            &lt;p&gt;s.
                            If you do need a paragraph you don't use &lt;h1&gt; or any of it's siblings...even if you
                            want
                            the paragraph to be big! Always use the tag that best describes the content.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Note</h2>
                    <p>At this point do not expect your page to
                        <em>look</em> like the wireframe. We are laying a foundation, but have not learned how to
                        position
                        elements yet. Don't worry if your page does not look like the wireframe at this point.</p>
                    <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Internal links</h3>
                    <p>Your page has an unordered list in the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element containing links. You
                        were
                        asked to add a couple more links last week for the child pages that you will be completing
                        later.
                        Make sure that they are links and not just plain text. Ensure each item in the list is a link
                        by
                        wrapping just the text (not the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>!) in an&nbsp;
                        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>
                        </a>&nbsp;tag. The&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>tag has one required attribute if you recall from Khan Academy:
                        <kbd>href=""</kbd>. This is where we tell the browser where the link should take us to. These
                        will
                        all be other pages on our site, but they don't exist yet. Let's just put
                        <kbd>index.html</kbd>&nbsp;in there for now. That way the link will work if it's clicked on. We
                        will
                        replace those with actual pages as we build them.</p>
                    <p>Each list item should look something like this:&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>
                    </p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>If you recall from the Khan academy lesson from this week links can be used to travel to
                            different
                            pages on the same site, to pages on a different site, and even to different places on the
                            same
                            web page.</p>
                        <p>It is often considered a good practice if you have a link that takes you away from the
                            current
                            site to have it open in a new window or tab. This can be done with the&nbsp;
                            <kbd>target="_blank"</kbd>&nbsp;attribute.</p>

                    <h3>External links</h3>

                    <p>Lets add some external links to social media to our site. Khan Academy taught this week that
                        more
                        than just text can be used to create links. In this case it would be appropriate to make an
                        image
                        the link instead.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Here a some icons (images) for some common social media sites that you can use for this next
                            step.
                            Or you can go find some of your own.</p>

                    <p>Select 3 social media sites and create a link to them in the footer of your page using an image.
                        Make
                        sure the link opens in a new window/tab. Add a <code>&lt;div class="social"&gt;</code> first to
                        the
                        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> below the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element that should already be
                        there
                        to hold all of your social links.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>When we added images before, we found the URL of the image (right click, copy image address), and
                            used that. In this case it would be better to download the image to our computer and then
                            upload
                            it to our host as part of the site.</p>
                        <p>If you right click on any of the images above you will see an option "Save image as..." Do
                            that.
                            Login to Glitch and drag each of the files you need into the browser window to upload
                            them.
                            Then you can click on the image to see an example of what the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag
                            should
                            look like.</p>
                        <p>The whole img tag with a src like above would look like this: </p>
                        <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/ce157a30-32b9-4d91-93c9-e3168e11c594%2Fface-book.png?1527710175064" alt="Facebook icon"&gt;

                    <p>We've been doing a lot with HTML so far...and in fact we have now added almost all the html we
                        will

                    <h3>External Stylesheets</h3>
                    <p>Let's add some styles! The Khan Academy lessons start out by having you add CSS in the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;portion of your page. There is actually a better way, and we are
                        already
                        setup to do it. We will use an external stylesheet instead of the Internal method Khan uses.</p>
                    <p>You may have noticed the line in your HTML that looks like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>You may have also noticed a file in your list called
                        <kbd>style.css</kbd>. The
                        <kbd>link</kbd> tag tells the html file where to find the CSS it should use to style the page.
                        We
                        will enter all of our CSS in the
                        <kbd>style.css</kbd> file. If you open up that file you will notice a bit of CSS already
                        written.
                        Let's remove that so that we start with a clean slate.</p>

                    <h3>Adding some color</h3>
                    <p>Headlines are usually important bits of text that are supposed to stand out. Size is one way to
                        accomplish
                        that, color is another. Let's change the color of our headlines to make them stand out more.
                        Let's
                        add some color to our&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> elements first. In the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>style.css</kbd> file let's make a CSS rule to do that.
                    </p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>CSS Basics</h4>
                        <p>Every CSS rule is made up of 3 elements. First we always need a
                            <strong>selector</strong>, in this case we want to modify any&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements on our page so our selector will be:&nbsp;
                            <kbd>h2</kbd>. Next there are always curly braces { } that form the
                            <strong>declaration block</strong>. Inside those braces we place one or more
                            <strong>declarations</strong>: pairs of 'property to change: value to change it to'</p>
                        <p>So in this example to change the background color of our&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>&nbsp;after adding the new rule our style block would look like
                            this:
                            (you should use one of your selected colors, probably not salmon)</p>
                        <pre><code class="lang-css">h2 {
    background-color: salmon;
}    </code></pre>
                        <p>It's worth taking a moment and talking about what valid options you have to designate color.
                            The
                            3 main ways are hexadecimal, rgb, and predefined color names. Take a moment to visit&nbsp;

                            </a>&nbsp;to get a brief outline about the differences. Also take a look at this&nbsp;

                    </div>
                    <p>For consistency we really should have ALL of our headlines be this same color. We could
                        copy/paste
                        our <kbd>h2</kbd> rule and just change the selector, but that's a lot of duplication. Instead
                        let's
                        modify our existing rule to add the selectors for <kbd>h1, h3, h4, h5, h6</kbd>. One rule can
                        accomplish
                        what we need with the right selectors!</p>

                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and we want the whole page to be inside of it. Place your opening
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> right after the opening
                        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag and the closing
                        <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> right before the closing &lt;/body&gt;. Add an id of
                        <kbd>content</kbd> to the
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>Your code should look something like this:</p>

                            very wide screens that can leave things very thin and not very attractive. We should use

                            narrow than what we choose? We could make a class and apply it to all&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>&nbsp;elements individually, and that would work, but there is an
                            easier
                            way.

                    <h3>Setting a width</h3>
                    <p>Apply a width to your whole page to keep it from stretching across the whole browser window by
                        making
                        a css rule for the div we added in the last step with the id of
                        <kbd>content</kbd>. In that rule let's set the max-width of the page to 960px. Doing it on that
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> will make sure that no element on the page can be wider than that.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Why <kbd>max-width</kbd> instead of just <kbd>width</kbd> you may be asking yourself?
                            Setting
                            a <kbd>width</kbd> on an element will make it so that is ALWAYS that size. We never know
                            what
                            size of a screen someone might be looking at our page with...so forcing something to always
                            be
                            a size is a bit dangerous. The fact is that we don't care what size the content of our page
                            is,
                            as long as it's not <em>wider</em> than 960px. It can certainly be narrower. Using <kbd>max-width</kbd>
                            allows for that. Our page can be whatever size the screen is...unless the screen is wider
                            than our limit...then it will stop
                            growing!

                    <h3>Block vs Inline</h3>


                    <p> There are two basic types of HTML elements:&nbsp;
                        <em>
                            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp" target="_blank">Block and Inline</a>
                        </em>.</p>
                    <p>Block elements are greedy. By default they take up 100% of the space they have available,
                        meaning
                        they will not allow any other element to share the line they are on...thus forcing line breaks
                        around
                        themselves. Most of the semantic elements we use for grouping related content fall into the
                        block
                        category, as well as&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, and&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</p>
                    <p>Inline elements like to share. They will allow as many other elements to share the line they are
                        on
                        until it is full...then they wrap. Some examples of inline elements are&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>,&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>and plain text</p>
                    <p>Another way to think of this is that block elements (if we are working in a top down, left to
                        right
                        language like english) flow vertically down the page, while inline elements flow horizontally
                        from
                        left to right across the page.</p>

                        Look
                        at the top of your home page (Screenshot to the right). Take a moment to consider why it looks
                        this
                        way? Why is the list of links down below the logo? Why does each link show on it's own line?
                        Most
                        importantly, the wireframe shows the links on the same line as the logo and each link in the
                        same
                        line as each other, how can we make them do that?
                    </p>
                    <p>(For the first question if you answered "because list items (<kbd>li</kbd>) and unordered lists
                        (
                        <kbd>ul</kbd>) are block elements" you are right! We will need to wait a bit on the answer for
                        the
                        second question :) )</p>

                        <p>We set the width, but the page still doesn't look right. It would look better if it were

                            instead of left aligned. Centering with CSS is not hard, but can be confusing. This is
                            because
                            block and inline elements are centered differently. Block elements are centered by setting
                            a
                            width and adjusting the left and right margin (
                            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin.asp" target="_blank">Margin</a> is the

                            elements are centered by using the

                    <h3>Block centering</h3>
                    <p>Let's center our content. The
                        <kbd>&lt;div&gt;</kbd> we set the width on is a block element, that means we will need to use
                        <kbd>margin</kbd> to center it. The idea is to set a width (we did this in the last step), then
                        tell
                        the browser to take whatever margin is available and split it between the left and right of the
                        element.
                        This is a lot easier than it sounds. Add
                        <kbd>margin: 0 auto;</kbd> to the CSS rule for
                        <kbd>#content</kbd>. We gave it 2 values. The first says to set the top and bottom margins to 0
                        and
                        the second says to set the left and right margins to auto: meaning to split any margin
                        available
                        between the left and right.

                    <p>While we are centering let's try an inline element now. On the wireframe the bottom section text
                        is
                        centered. Apply the
                        <kbd>text-align: center;</kbd> style to the bottom section (you should have placed that
                        headline
                        and paragraph in a box earlier). You should have added a class to that box last week with a
                        meaningful
                        name like <kbd>home-paragraph-3</kbd>. Use that to apply the style.

                    <h3>Setting a background color</h3>
                    <p>Our next step is to add a background color to the entire page to liven it up a bit.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>If we want to do something to the entire page...what should the selector for our rule be? We
                            actually
                            have a couple of options in this case. Our entire page is inside two elements. <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                            and
                            <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code>. Either could work to set the color, but there would
                            be some differences. In this case we set a width on the <code>&lt;div id="content"&gt;</code>
                            element...so if we set the <kbd>background-color</kbd> there then we might end up with
                            uncolored background at some widths...not good. To make sure that the background is always
                            colored where we expect it to be let's set it at the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>If you don't already have one, add a css rule for <kbd>body</kbd>, so we can add a declaration
                        to change <kbd>background-color</kbd>
                        to that. In the style guide you should have chosen a background color to use. Go get the hex
                        code for that color and add
                        it to your css. My rule looks like this. Yours should be similar:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">body {
       background-color: #396e94;

                    </code></pre>

                    <h3>Link color</h3>
                    <p>The color you changed the background of the&nbsp; page to may have made your links hard to read.
                        In
                        the site plan you should have chosen a color for your navigation links. Add the following line
                        to
                        your css rule to change the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>color</kbd>&nbsp;for the text in the&nbsp;
                        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;. Again replace the color with one from your chosen palette. Pick
                        something
                        that looks good with the background color and that is easily readable.</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">nav {
    color: #ee1010;
}    
        </code></pre>
                    <p>What changed? Nothing!!? Read below for an explanation why.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Take a look at your page. Pay particular attention to our new links. Did the color change?
                            Your
                            carefully chosen color is probably still blue or purple! CSS stands for Cascading Style
                            Sheets.
                            the Cascading part means that you can have more than one set of styles apply to an element,
                            and
                            that they will cascade down with the rules closest to the element taking precedence.</p>
                        <p>We applied a color change at the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;level, but&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;tags have some default styling as well and the
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;is closer to the text we want styled than the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>&nbsp;is so those styles override ours. If we want the links to
                            change
                            back to the color we chose we will need to move our rule closer...override the default
                            styling
                            of the&nbsp;
                            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>&nbsp;itself most likely. W3Schools has some more info on the idea
                            of&nbsp;

                    <p>
                        <em>Really</em> change the color of your navigation link text by adding a rule with
                        <code>"nav a"</code> as the selector. Then add your
                        <code>color: #whatever your color is;</code> to that rule. (We will learn more about that combo
                        selector
                        in a week or two)</p>
                    <p>Your new css rule should look something like this (change the color to one of your colors)</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-css">nav a {
    color: #ee1010;
}    
        </code></pre>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>More background color</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the color you chose for your background, our paragraphs may have become difficult
                        to
                        read. Let's change the background behind those back to white to fix this. All of our paragraphs
                        are
                        inside of the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element. That would be a good place to set our white
                        color.
                        Add a rule using <kbd>main</kbd> as the selector to your CSS to do that.

                        <!-- END STEP -->
                </li>
                <!-- <li>
                    
                    <h3>Headline colors</h3>
                    <p>Next let's make our headlines stand out a little more. Lets change the color of all headlines again
                        to one of the colors in your palette. Since we need to make sure everything from&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;h1&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;h6&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;gets the same styling we will take advantage of the fact that you can
                        apply the same styles to more than one selector, so we can write one rule instead of six to change
                        them all.
                    </p>
                    <p>To have a set of rules apply to more than one selector we separate them with a comma. So the rule
                        to change the color of all headlines would look something like this:</p>
                    <h2>Multiple selector Example</h2>
                    <pre><code class="css">
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
        color: #6495ED;
}    
                </code>
                </pre>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    
                    <h3>Paragraph color</h3>
                    <p>Changing the color of the second section may have made the text there hard to read. For our final
                        step lets use a class selector to change the color of that text. Add a&nbsp;
                        <kbd>class=""</kbd>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;
                        <kbd>&lt;p&gt;</kbd>&nbsp;inside the second section. Choose a descriptive name for the class, then
                        create a css rule to change the color. Remember that you need to precede your rule with a '.' so
                        that the browser knows it's looking for the&nbsp;
                        <em>class</em>&nbsp;and not a&nbsp;
                        <em>tag</em>. If done correctly it should only change the text of the paragraph we applied the class
                        to.
                    </p>
