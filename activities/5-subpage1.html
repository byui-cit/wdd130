                    <h3>Create the new HTML file</h3>
                    <p>For this assignment, choose one of the pages you identified last week and made wireframes for
                        that
                        you will
                        complete as your sub-page. A sub-page is a page with links back and forth to your main
                        page. You only need to code one sub-page for the rafting site.</p>
                    <div class="callout">
                        <p>Want a shortcut? We know that many of the elements from our home page should also be on your
                            child
                            page: header, navigation, footer, colors, etc. So use the <kbd>index.html</kbd> as a
                            starting
                            point. Make a new file in your editor and save it with a meaningful name (for example if I
                            were
                            making a contact page I would name my new file <kbd>contact.html</kbd>) then copy and
                            paste the
                            code from your index.html into your new file, update the <kbd>&lt;title&gt;</kbd>, and
                            delete the
                            content that is specific to the home page and Voila! You have a great start on your new
                            page.</p>
                        <h4>Note</h4>
                        <p>You do not want to create a new .css file for this new page. This could create a problem of
                            having
                            pages look different in important ways because the styles in one file were updated and not
                            the
                            other. You should only have <strong>one</strong> .css file for your entire site. Add any
                            new styles
                            for this new html page to the bottom of your existing .css.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!--  END STEP  -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--  BEGIN STEP  -->
                    <h3>Add new content</h3>
                    <p>Add the html necessary in your new page to contain the new content.</p>

                    <p>Remember that the content I have provided can be found in I-Learn or here: subpage content.</p>

                    <p>Pay attention to your wireframe and try to make the HTML represent your layout, ie. create boxes
                        (sections or divs) to represent the rows and columns of your layout and to group related
                        content together. Open your website into your browser to make sure the web page displays
                        correctly. Pay special attention to whether your images are all displaying. Once verified,
                        begin adding the CSS to your site .css file to finish the page.</p>

                    <p>Once you finish the first subpage, repeat the process for the second. Both pages are due with
                        the final on the last week. To make sure you don't run out of time get one of your subpages
                        done by the end of week 8.</p>

                <h2>Grading</h2>
                <p>This activity will be graded next week using the following rubric:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significant textual content consisting of appropriate content for your audience so that they
                        can
                        understand the meaning and message of the page. There must also be at least one image in
                        addition
                        to the logo. You must have working links to your main page and any child pages (to and from)
                        you
                        are creating for this website. Your header (logo/navigation bar) and your footer
                        (copyright/name
                        and social media icon links) from the main page. Your page must be visually appealing. (20 pts)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <h3>What is meant by &ldquo;visually appealing?&rdquo;</h3>
                <p>I wish there was a non-subjective way to measure this, but there isn't. Generally you only lose
                    points for this with things that are obvious. For example, text that is difficult to read because
                    it uses a color to similar to the background, a navigation bar that is directly against a banner or
                    the text of the page rather than having some space around it, use of a color scheme that obviously
                    indicates no thought was put into the color choices (this doesn't mean that you can't use white -
                    it's more stating that if you just threw colors onto the page for the sake of throwing colors onto
                    the page and it is obvious, you'll lose points), etc.</p>
                <p>If you simply copy and pasted the text from the content page in most cases it will <strong>not</strong>
                    be visually appealing. Make sure that you format it to make it more readable! Be generous with
                    &lt;p&gt; tags, padding, margins, and maybe even &lt;ul&gt;s. You <strong>will</strong> lose points
                    on this if you do not put some thought into the readability of the text.</p>
                <h3>What is considered &ldquo;significant content?&rdquo;</h3>
                <p>Each page of a website should clearly convey to the user what the page is for. If it is a main or home
                    page, it should provide the user with enough information to know what your site is about, whether
                    it contains the information or products they are looking for, and, thereby, whether they should stick
                    around and keep looking through your website. As another example, if you have a "Contact Us" page,
                    you usually need more than just a contact form and email address. The page should have enough
                    information that the user knows what the contact form and email address is for, what happens when they
                    contact you, what type of information you want the user to provide when contacting you, etc.</p>
