        <p>
          Last week you got a look at a
          <a href="../images/wireframe-grid.png" target="_blank">wireframe</a>
          while building out your site plan. Wireframes are valuable tools in
          web design. They help visualize what should be on a page, and where
          each piece of content should be in relation to each other. We need to
          stop however and learn a little bit about how to read a wireframe, and
          how to take a wireframe and convert it into HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will <strong>not</strong> be learning to make wireframes at this
          point. Only using them.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <h3>Reading wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              First visit
              <a
                href="https://fuzzymath.com/blog/how-to-read-a-wireframe/"
                target="_blank"
                >How to read a wireframe</a
              >
              and spend some time looking at the infographic to familiarize
              yourself with what you can expect to find on a wireframe.
            </p>

            <h3>From Wireframe to Website</h3>
            <p>
              Next watch the videos <strong>two</strong> through
              <strong>five</strong> in this playlist:
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfoSnpsDRhTgz6VrVPvYqvR"

                >From Wireframe to Website</a
              >
              (~10 minutes). This is a great example of what we need to do with
              our wireframe this week...convert it into HTML. Pay careful
              attention to how HTML elements are used in two ways: to display
              content, and group and show relationships between content.

              and convert it into HTML. You will probably want to create a new
              HTML file in your project to do this in. You are welcome to help
              each other out with this task. You may find the following
              resources helpful.

                <a href="https://placeimg.com" target="_blank">PlaceIMG</a>:
                Placeholder image generator. We need something to use as images
                for our page. This is a quick and easy way to get some. Usage:
                <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;img src="https://placeimg.com/320/240/animals" /&gt;</code> </pre>
                This would give you a random image that was 320px X 240px large.

            </ul>

            <h3>Important!</h3>
            <p>
              Remember that our goal is not to produce a finished version of the
              example site. It will look much like the site in the videos looked
              by video five...very rough. We are only trying to make sure we get
              all of the markup to include all of the content represented in the
              wireframe. Your finished page <strong>WILL NOT</strong> look like
              the wireframe.
            </p>
            <p>
              NO CSS is required for this weeks assignment. You should only be
              writing HTML.
