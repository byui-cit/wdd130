        <h3>What is a Site Plan?</h3>
        <p>
          Developing a site plan is a critical step in any web design process.
          Site plans help establish the purpose of the site, the voice, and
          overall look and feel...and then they help you apply those
          consistently across your site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Site plans come in many shapes and sizes, and level of detail. Here is
          a list of common elements in a site plan
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement of purpose and goals</li>
          <li>Definition of audience</li>
          <li>
            personas and scenarios - Who will use the site and how will they use
            it?
          </li>
          <li>
            A Style guide:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Branding information - how to use the branding for the site
                correctly
              </li>
              <li>Typography choices and justification</li>
              <li>Color palette</li>
              <li>
                Specific styling of elements on the site...ie headings, lists,
                paragraphs, forms, links, buttons, etc
              </li>
              <li>A site map</li>
              <li>
                Wireframes showing general layout and content for major pages
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will be making a simplified site plan for our web site. Ours will
          focus on the sections for Purpose, audience and a partial style guide.
          Since the style guide will be the largest portion lets take a look at
          a few examples to get a better idea about how they are put together.
        </p>

        <p>
          FamilySearch has a nice styleguide viewable by anyone. Notice how many
          colors they use! As you browse around the actual site do you think
          it's too many or does it work? Notice that they also have a section
          about font sizes and paragraph and headline styling, but it never
          really mentions which fonts they use.
        </p>

          Take a moment and think about the purpose and audience of the site.
          Does the site accomplish the purpose well and cater to its audience?

          A List Apart is a website by web designers for web designers. Much of
          it's content comes from guest authors so having a well defined style
          guide is essential to keep everything consistent. The different fonts
          and colors are clearly defined, then it defines the styling for the
          many different elements you might find in an article...it even
          includes example html!

        <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
        <p>
          All of those examples were much bigger and more complex than what we
          will do for our site. However even though our site will be a simple 2
          page website for a White Water Rafting Company, this planning phase is
          still important and you are expected to produce a site plan that is
          complete and professional looking.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Template</h3>

            <p>
              Begin by logging into your editor (Glitch). Look for two files:
              <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> and <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd>. Open the
              <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> file. You will notice lots of HTML
              comments in the file. See an example below:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;!-- In the header above, add your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 100.03 --&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              <strong>Read all of the comments!</strong> They include important
              instructions. You will also see portions of text wrapped in square
              brackets like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;h2&gt;WDD 130-[section]&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              In this case you will be expected to replace the
              <kbd>[section]</kbd> with your information. There shouldn't be any
              square brackets left in the file when you are done!
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a minute right now to review both of the site-plan files. The
              HTML one should look somewhat familiar from last week. Try to
              follow what is going on in that file and guess what each line will
              do. The CSS one will be new. Look over it as an example of CSS and
              try to identify examples of the CSS terms introduced in the
              <a href="cssvocab.html">CSS Vocabulary</a> activity, but you are
              not expected to understand everything that is going on there at
              this point. (Go and complete the vocabulary activity right now if
              you have not done it!)
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>

            <p>
              From the beginning, websites have always been about displaying
              content. This is the underlying purpose behind every site on the
              internet, or at least it should be. In order to determine which
              content you should put on the site it is critical to determine the
              purpose or goals of the site. The content should support that
              purpose. At a high level these purposes can take many forms:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Build Revenue&nbsp;</strong>Build revenues for your
                new/existing business or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Information&nbsp;</strong>Share corporate or
                educational information or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Opinions&nbsp;</strong>Share opinions on a subject
                or
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Share Personal Interests&nbsp;</strong>Share personal
                interests with family and friends
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All websites should have a purpose, and that purpose should be
              more than 'My teacher is making me do this.' :) Earlier (see
              above) you should have spent some time analyzing a few websites to
              try and determine what their purpose is, and who their audience
              is.
            </p>

            <p>
              We need to do this now for our website. One problem: the purpose
              really needs to be defined by the site owner and not the site
              builder. So for this step and the next imagine that you are the
              owner of the business and have decided that it is time for you to
              have an online presence.&nbsp;
              <strong
                >Develop a purpose statement that clearly defines your goals for
                the website</strong
              >. Find the portion of the <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd> file for the
              purpose. (It should be around line 22-23). It looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;h3&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Your purpose here]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- change this --&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Replace <kbd>[Your purpose here]</kbd> with your purpose
              statement. (at least 100 words)
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Audience Statement</h3>

            <p>
              Another important factor to keep in mind when planning a website,
              is the audience for the site. Remember, that websites are all
              about content. The purpose helps define what content you should
              include, and the content should target your specific audience or
              audiences (websites can have more than one).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Write a statement specifically identifying your target
                audience</strong
              >. Try to answer these questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business)
                situation (age, financial situation, interests, etc)
              </li>
              <li>What do they want?</li>
              <li>What are their needs that aren't being met?</li>
              <li>
                How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop,
                mobile device)? (at least 100 words)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Add your Audience to your siteplan just like you did for the
              Purpose above.
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                Color plays an essential role in any website and so the colors
                you use should be chosen deliberately. There are volumes of
                material on color theory that can help with these choices.

              space bar on your keyboard to generate different complementary
              color schemes for the color you chose. Feel free to lock other
              colors and generate until you end up with 3-4 colors you like.

              Once you have built your palette note that at the bottom of each
              color column there is a 6 digit "number". This is what is known as
              a hexadecimal color code and is usually preceded by a "#". These
              codes are the most common way to represent colors on the web. Copy
              that code for the 3-4 colors you would like to use into the Site
              plan document (around line 50-60). Place the color you want to use
              the most often as the primary.
            </p>
            <p>
              After entering the codes into the HTML file switch to the
              <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file. Look at lines 8-11. Notice that
              there is a place to record your colors there as well. Do so, then
              look at the Preview. You should see your colors showing in
              different areas!

              You should save your chosen palette URL from coolers.co in case
              you need to make any changes later. Copy the URL of your scheme.
              (mine looked like this:
              https://coolors.co/b7d3f2-afafdc-8a84e2-84afe6-79beee) and paste
              it into your <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>
              <strong>in two places</strong> Look around line 40-60 for the line
              that looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">Palette URL: &lt;a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c" target="_blank"&gt;https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

              Notice that when working with links in HTML the destination of the
              link goes in the <kbd>src</kbd> attribute. Then the part you click
              on goes inside of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element. Often those
              will be different...but in this case we are going to make them

            <h3>About Fonts</h3>

            <p>
              It's time now to choose a font or fonts that you will use for your
              site. Along with the colors you choose, fonts have the next
              largest (or maybe even larger in some cases) impact on the look
              and feel of your site. To help you think about this watch the
              following short video and review the tips below.
            </p>
            <div class="videoWrapper">
              <iframe
                width="560"

                allowfullscreen=""
              ></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>Here are a few tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Make sure the main font you use (the one that most of the text
                  is in) is very readable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is OK, and often desirable to have more than 1 font on a
                  page, but if you use more than 2 make sure you have a good
                  reason for it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you use 2 fonts make sure there is good contrast between
                  them...ie make sure they are different enough that they will
                  never be mistaken for the same font. A common pattern is to
                  have a very readable font from one font-family (serif,
                  san-serif, script, monospace, fantasy) for all the body copy
                  (paragraphs), and a font from another family for the titles
                  and headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While you should usually sacrifice creativeness for
                  readability for paragraphs, you can usually get away with
                  something more fun for headlines. They are usually larger in
                  size and only a few words in length, so feel free to
                  experiment a bit more here.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For a page that loads very quickly you should stick with
                  web-safe fonts. These are fonts that can be found on every
                  computer. (Not all fonts are on every computer.) A list can be
                  found on
                  <a
                    href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp"
                    target="_blank"
                    >W3Schools</a
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts" target="_blank"
                    >Google has a large list of Fonts</a
                  >
                  that can be used on websites as well. Using them will add a
                  small amount of time to the speed at which the page
                  loads...but often it is worth it to get the right font.

            <h3>Choose your fonts</h3>
            <p>
              Choose one or two fonts to use for the site and record them along
              with your <em>reasoning for choosing</em> them in the Site Plan.
              Then we need to enter your fonts into the CSS file as well so we
              can really see what they will look like.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any of your fonts are from Google then look at line 4 in
              <kbd>site-plan.html</kbd>. This line lets our page know where to
              find the fonts we need. Change the example font names there to
              your fonts. Notice that if your font name has any spaces in it you
              should replace them with '+'. Look at my example:
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to use the following two fonts from Google:
              <kbd>IM Fell French Canon SC</kbd> and <kbd>Lato</kbd>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC|Lato');
                        </code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice in the <code>@import</code> my first font got changed to:
              <kbd>IM+Fell+French+Canon+SC</kbd> (spaces replaced with +). My
              second font was a simple one word font to it was added just as it
              was with a <kbd>|</kbd> (shift + \) separating my fonts.
            </p>

            <h3>Color your fonts</h3>
            <p>
              Often you want your text to appear on a colored background. Let's
              pick some colors from your pallette that will work well together.
            </p>
            <p>
              See if there are two colors in your scheme that can be used as
              text color/background color where the text remains readable (you
              need a high contrast between the colors). Black and White are
              always fair game even if they aren't in your color scheme :)
            </p>
            <p>
              Switch to the <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file and look at lines
              18-22. Should look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">--headline-color-on-white: black;  /* headlines on a white background */ 
--headline-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* headlines on a colored background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-white: black; /* paragraph text on a white background */ 
--paragraph-color-on-color: #FFFFFF; /* paragraph text on a colored background */ 
--text-background-color: #000000;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Change the <code>--text-background-color</code> and then
              <code>--headline-color-on-color</code> and
              <code>--paragraph-color-on-color</code> values. If done correctly
              you should see an example of your colors together in the Preview
              of your page in Glitch. If any of the text is hard to read then
              try different colors.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Style your navigation</h3>
            <p>
              Finally from your <em>color palette</em> choose the colors you
              would like to use for your navigational links (normal, hover,
              active, and visited) and enter those colors in lines 23-26 in the
              <kbd>site-plan.css</kbd> file. If you would like specific styling
              for other links on the pages you can provide those on the Links
              section under HTML elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of two child pages you would be interested in creating
              (these may change as time goes on) and put the names in each of
              the two empty boxes in the nav bar image. (In the directions,
              there are several page suggestions listed. You can choose two of
              those or come up with your own, but the names should be one or two
              words max.) We will eventually build only one of these pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next section is the site map. It also has 3 boxes: home and
              two empty boxes. Put the same two child page names you chose for
              the nav bar boxes.... these MUST be the same names for both parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last page has a wireframe. The wireframe shows what the page
              will look like, how it will be laid out. We will not be changing
              the wireframe yet, just review it. In the following weeks you will
              use the wireframe provided to help you to create the home page for
              the site. Even later in the semester you will create wireframes
              for the two pages you selected above, and build them as well.
