            Nothing makes a webpage feel like more of a product and less of a
            project than changing from the default fonts. You should have chosen
            one or two fonts when you were putting the site plan together for
            your site. Go review that now.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you chose fonts from among the
            <a
              href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp"
              target="_blank"
              >web-safe list</a
            >&nbsp;then you can use them just like Khan academy showed you this
            week. (Here is another list of the web-safe fonts:&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank"
              >http://www.cssfontstack.com/</a
            >)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you chose fonts from Google Fonts or elsewhere then we have to
            make the font available to the web page first before we can use
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter which fonts you are using it is always a good idea to list
            some fallback fonts, in case for some reason your first choice
            doesn't work correctly; you can control how it degrades. Your
            second choice should be similar to your first (and usually
            web-safe), the third font in the list should usually be one of the
            default font families. (serif, san-serif, fantasy, monospace, or
            script)
          </p>
          <p>
            So for example if I chose Helvetica&nbsp;as my font for body copy I
            would add something like&nbsp;
            <kbd>font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</kbd>&nbsp;to a rule
            modifying the&nbsp; <kbd>body</kbd> of my page.
          </p>
          <p>
            If; however, I wanted to use the font Rock Salt for my headlines,
            that is not a web safe font and will probably not be on most
            computers. I have to do an extra step to make it available.
          </p>

            Google Fonts makes it very easy to add your fonts. Find your font in
            Google Fonts and click it: 
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_1.png"
                alt="googlefont"
                title="googlefont"
                width="70px"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then click on the 'Select this style' to expand it. 
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_2.png"
                alt="googlefont2"
                title="googlefont2"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then click on the 'Embed' tab and the '@import' tab.
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../images/google_font_3.png"
                alt="googlefont2"
                title="googlefont2"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Copy the line that starts with '@import' and add it to the
            <strong>top</strong> of your <kbd>style.css</kbd> file. It should
            look something like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-markup">
@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rock+Salt);
...the rest of your css...            
</code></pre>

          <p>
            Now you can use that font just like normal, ie:&nbsp;
            <kbd>font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive;</kbd>
          </p>
        </div>
        <ol class="bigSteps">

            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Change your Body font</h3>
            <p>
              Based on your font choices from your site plan, add the
              appropriate&nbsp; <kbd>font-family:</kbd>, and&nbsp;
              <kbd>@import</kbd>&nbsp;lines to your CSS to change the body font
              and headline font on your webpage.

            <h3>Adjusting font size</h3>
            <p>
              Often the default font sizes are fine, but there are times when
              they need to be changed. For example, it's suitable for the links used
              for navigation to be easy to click, so lets increase
              their size. Let's make it 110% of normal. (Remember the "em" unit
              of measurement for fonts. 1em = the normal size of your font, so
              1.1em = 110%)
            </p>
            <div class="callout" style="overflow:auto;">
              <img
                src="../images/paddingexample.jpg"
                alt="paddingexample"
                title="paddingexample"
                class="right"
              />
              <p>
                It is nice to have those fonts in there. Now notice what is
                happening anywhere that you have made colored boxes around
                anything. Here is an example:
              </p>
              <p>
                The font and image are pressed right up against the edge of the
                border and it looks terrible. Lets fix it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The space between the content in a box and the edge of a box is
                called
                <a
                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_padding.asp"
                  target="_blank"
                  >padding</a
                >. We can add padding to one or all sides. For example, if I
                wanted to add some padding to all 4 sides of the box I would do
                something like this:&nbsp; <kbd>padding: 1em;</kbd>&nbsp;(We
                will learn more about padding next week)
              </p>

            <h3>Adding Padding</h3>
            <p>
              Use <kbd>padding</kbd> to space out the content on your page from
              any edges or borders where it is needed.
            </p>

            <h3>Paying attention to promixity</h3>
            <p>
              Proximity is a design principle that we rely on to help to know
              which elements on our page are related to each other by their
              distance from each other. Right now, the headlines are the
              same distance from the images as they are from the paragraphs.
              This can confuse visitors. Do the headlines
              describe the images or the text? It is hard to know currently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's make sure that visitors to our site know that the headlines
              and paragraphs are related to each other by bringing them a little
              closer together. Adjust the&nbsp; <kbd>line-height</kbd>&nbsp; and
              <kbd>margin</kbd>s of your headlines to bring them closer to the
              paragraphs they belong to. You could even play with the
              line-height of your paragraphs to see how it affects readability
              as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are done the headlines should be closer to the paragraphs
              than they are to the images.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP  -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>Why isn't it working?</h3>
            <p>
              Using <kbd>line-height</kbd>&nbsp; and <kbd>margin</kbd> on the
              headline were you able to get the headline closer to the paragraph
              than it is to the image? You probably didn't, so what is going on?

            <h3>Browser developer tools</h3>
            <p>
              If you are having a hard time getting your headlines to come
              closer to your paragraphs try this: right click on one of your
              headlines and select "Inspect." An area on your browser should
              open at either the side or bottom of the screen that shows both
              the html and the styles for that element. This is a powerful tool.
            </p>
            <p>When I did this I saw the following:</p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="../images/inspect1.jpg"
                  alt="inspect element example"
                />
              </figure>
            </div>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Notice that browser is showing me the size of the element in
                pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's also showing me where the element I have inspected is both
                in the code (right) and the browser window (left). On the
                left, it shows the area it takes up both for size (blue
                highlight) and margins (brown highlight). If there were any
                padding, it would be green. If you look at the code, you will
                probably see a bunch of stuff in the html that you don't
                remember adding to your page! Glitch added that to help it do
                what it needs to do. You can ignore everything prefixed with
                'data-'
              </li>
              <li>
                All the styles are shown. The third arrow shows styles I
                defined.
              </li>
              <li>
                This arrow shows several styles I
                <strong>did not</strong> define. Notice it says "user agent
                stylesheet" That's just another way of saying "browser default
                styling".
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally we get a graphical representation of the
                <a
                  href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp"
                  target="_blank"
                  >CSS Box Model</a
                >
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The highlighted area, styles, and the box model are all showing in
              different ways that an <kbd>&lt;h2&gt;</kbd> has top and bottom
              margins defined by default. Those defaults are probably
              interfering with your desire to move the headline closer to the
              paragraph.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP  -->
          </li>

            <!-- START STEP -->
            <h3>More Inspecting</h3>
            <p>
              Now select the paragraph element below the title we are working
              with. Right-click on the paragraph and select "Inspect" again.
              This will target that element in the DOM inspector. (Or just click
              on the paragraph element in the HTML Element pane)
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img src="../images/inspect2.jpg" alt="box model example" />
                <figcaption>
                  A paragraph element in the developer tools
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
            <p>
              What do you see? If you noticed that this paragraph (in fact ALL
              paragraphs) also have some default top and bottom margin great
              job! :)
            </p>
            <p>
              When two elements by each other both have top and bottom margins,
              the browser collapses the smaller margin and keeps the larger. So
              before we changed anything the bottom margin of the
              <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> was about 22px (see first inspect figure
              above), and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> had a top margin of 18px.
              The space between the elements would be 22px. If we changed the
              bottom margin of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to 0 then the space
              between the two elements would still be 18px...because of the
              <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> default styles. To get the two elements to
              move closer together then, we need to address both margins!
            </p>
            <p>
              We have two choices here: we could set a rule for both the
              headlines AND the paragraphs and adjust margins on both, or we can
              take advantage of the fact that margins can be NEGATIVE.

              A positive margin pushes two elements apart, a negative one pulls
              them closer together.
            </p>
            <p>
              In your browser tools try adding a negative
              <kbd>margin-bottom</kbd> to the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> we are
              trying to style. Once you find a value that looks good, add a rule
              to your <kdb>style.css</kdb> to fix all your headlines that have
              paragraphs following them.
